# Things to change:
#  -- If computer has perfect lookahead, it decides (correctly) that perfect
#     enemy play will always lead to a draw. Therefore it considers all
#     starting moves equally valuable. This is not ideal. It should prefer
#     moves that maximally constrain the other player to playing perfectly.
#     Then, when facing a nonideal opponent, it will maximize its likelihood
#     of winning.
# -- Static board strength evaluator should weight 2 aligned pieces more
#    than 2X value of a single unblocked piece. (2 pieces force immediate
#    response in 3x3, while 1 piece gives slack.) This is a hypothesis.
#    Could check by the following point.
# -- Allow both computers to use different algorithms (not just different
#    depths). E.g., one could weight static boards differently, and we
#    could discover the best play.
# -- Extend NxN play to only need to get 3 in a row, not N-in-a-row, which
#    is almost impossible to win.
